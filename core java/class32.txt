Marker interface
===============
Interface which does not contain methods and constants is called marker interface.

In general, empty interface is called marker interface.

We have following list of marker interfaces.
ex:
	Serializable 
	Cloneable 
	Remote 
	and etc.

Using maker interface we will get some ability to do by JVM.

Abstract class
==============
It is a collection of zero or more abstract methods and concrete methods.

A "abstract" keyword is applicable for methods and classes but not for variables.

It is not possible to create object for abstract classes.

To write the implementation of abstract methods we will use sub classes.

By default every abstract method is a public and abstract.

It contains only instance variables.

If we know partial implementation then we need to use abstract class.

ex:
---
abstract class Plan 
{
	//instance variable 
	protected double rate;
	
	//abstract method 
	public abstract void getRate();
	
	//concrete method 
	public void calculateBillAmt(int units)
	{
		System.out.println("Total Units :"+units);
		System.out.println("Total Bill :"+ (rate*units));
	}
}
class DomesticPlan extends Plan 
{
	public void getRate()
	{
		rate = 2.5d;
	}
}
class CommercialPlan extends Plan 
{
	public void getRate()
	{
		rate = 5.0d;
	}
}
class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		DomesticPlan dp = new DomesticPlan();
		dp.getRate();
		dp.calculateBillAmt(250);
		
		CommercialPlan cp = new CommercialPlan();
		cp.getRate();
		cp.calculateBillAmt(250);
	}
}

Abstraction Example
===================
abstract class Animal
{
	public abstract void sound();
}
class Dog extends Animal
{
	@Override
	public void sound()
	{
		System.out.println("Bow Bow");
	}
}
class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Dog d = new Dog();
		d.sound();
	}
}

Packages 
=========
A package is a collection of classes and interfaces.

A package is also known as folder or a directory.

In java, we have two types of packages.

1) Predefined packages 

2) Userdefined packages 

1) Predefined packages 
------------------------
Built-In packages are called predefined packages.
ex:
	java.lang
	java.io
	java.util
	java.util.stream
	java.text
	java.time 
	java.sql
	and etc.


2) Userdefined packages
------------------------
Packages which are created by the user based on the application requirement are called userdefined packages.

syntax:
------
	package   <package_name>;

It is recommanded to declare package name in reverse order of url.

ex:
	package  com.google.www;
		
ex:
---
package com.ihub.www;
import java.util.Calendar;
class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Calendar c = Calendar.getInstance();
		int h = c.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY);
		
		if(h<12)
			System.out.println("good Morning");
		else if(h<16)
			System.out.println("Good Afternoon");
		else if(h<20)
			System.out.println("Good Evening");
		else
			System.out.println("Good Night");
	}
}

We can compile above program by using below command.
ex:
		current_directory 
		      |
	javac   -d    .    Test.java
		|
	destination folder 


We can run above program by using below command.
ex:
	java    com.ihub.www.Test 
			|      |
		package_name  classname 


Assignment

class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		for(int i=1;i<=4;i++)
		{
			for(int j=1;j<=i;j++)
			{
				if(j==1)
					System.out.print(j);
				else
					System.out.print(" # "+j);
			}
