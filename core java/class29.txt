2) Multi-Level inheritance 
===========================
If we derived a class in the presence of one base class and that class is derived from another base class is called multi-level inheritance.

ex:
	A
	|
	|
	B
	|
	|
	C 

ex:
---
class A 
{
	public void m1()
	{
		System.out.println("M1-Method");
	}
}
class B extends A 
{
	public void m2()
	{
		System.out.println("M2-Method");
	}
}
class C extends B 
{
	public void m3()
	{
		System.out.println("M3-Method");
	}
}
class Test  
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		A a = new A();
		a.m1();
		
		B b = new B();
		b.m1();
		b.m2();
		
		C c = new C();
		c.m1();
		c.m2();
		c.m3();
	}
}

3) Multiple inheritance 
=======================
In java, we can extends more then one class simultenously because java does not support multiple inheritance.
ex:
	class A 
	{
	}
	class B 
	{	
	}
	class C extends A,B  --> Invalid 
	{
	}

But interface can extends more then one interface so we can achieve multiple inheritance concept through interfaces.
ex:
	interface A 
	{
	}
	interface B
	{
	}
	interface C extends A,B --> valid 
	{	
	}
	
If our class does not extends any other class then it is a direct child class of Object class.
ex:			Diag:
	class A 		Object
	{			|
	}			|
				A 

If our class extends some other class then it is a indirect child class of Object class.
ex:			diag:
	class A 		Object
	{			|
	}			|
	class B extends A 	A 
	{			|
	}			|			
				B 

Java does not support cylic inheritance.
ex:
	class A extends B 
	{
	}
	class B extends A 
	{	
	}

Q) Why java does not support multiple inheritance?

There is a chance of raising ambiguity problem thats why java does not support multiple inheritance.

ex:
	P1.m1()		   	  P2.m1()
	|------------------------------|
			|	
			c.m1();	 

4) Hierarchical inheritance
===========================
If we derived multiple classes by using one base class is called hierarchical inheritance.

ex:
		A
		|
	|----------------|
	B		 C 

ex:
---
class A 
{
	public void m1()
	{
		System.out.println("M1-Method");
	}
}
class B extends A 
{
	public void m2()
	{
		System.out.println("M2-Method");
	}
}
class C extends A 
{
	public void m3()
	{
		System.out.println("M3-Method");
	}
}
class Test  
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		A a = new A();
		a.m1();
		
		B b = new B();
		b.m1();
		b.m2();
		
		C c = new C();
		c.m1();
		c.m3();
	}
}

5) Hybrid inheritance 
====================
It is a combination of more then two inheritance.
Java does not support hybrid inheritance.
ex:
		A
		|
	|----------------|
	B		 C 
	|----------------|
		|
		D 
	
Has-A relationship 
==================
Has-A relationship is also known as composition and aggregation.

There is no specific keyword to implements Has-A relationship but mostly we will use new operator.

The main objective of Has-A relationship is to provide reusability.

ex:
	class Trainer
	{
		// Trainer specific functionality 
	}
	class Course 
	{
		Trainer t = new Trainer();
		-
		-
	}

Has-A relationship will increase dependency between two components.

ex:
--
class Ihub 
{
	public String courseName()
	{
		return "Full Stack Java";
	}
	public double courseFee()
	{
		return 30000d; 
	}
	public String trainerName()
	{
		return "Niyaz Sir";
	}
}
class Usha 
{
	public void getCourseDetails()
	{
		Ihub i = new Ihub();
		System.out.println("Course Name :"+i.courseName());
		System.out.println("Course Fee :"+i.courseFee());
		System.out.println("Trainer Name :"+i.trainerName());
	}
}
class Student 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Usha u = new Usha();
		u.getCourseDetails();
	}
}

Composition 
===========
Without existing container object there is no chance of having contained object then relationship between container and contained object is called composition which is strongly association.

Aggregation  
===========
Without existing container object there is a chance of having contained object then relationship between container and contained object is called aggregation which is loosely association.
