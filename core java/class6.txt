History of Java
===============
In 1990, Sun Micro System took one project to develop a software called consumer electronic device which can be controlled by a remote like setup box. That time project was called Stealth project and later they have renamed to Green project. 

James Gosling, Mike Sheradin and Patrick Naughton were there to develop the project. They met in a place called Aspan/Colarado to start the work with Graphic system. James Gosling decided to use C and C++ languages to develop the project. But the problem what they have faced is C and C++ languages are system dependent. Then James Gosling decided why don't we create our own programming language which is system independent.

In 1991, they have developed one programming language called an OAK. OAK means coffee seed name, it is a national tree for many countries like Germany, France, USA and etc.

Later in 1995, they have renamed OAK to JAVA. Java is a island of an Indonesia where first coffee of seed was produced. During the development of project they were consuming lot of coffee's. Hence symbol of java is a cup of coffee with saucer.

Q) What is the difference between JDK, JRE and JVM?

JDK 
----
JDK stands for Java Development Kit.
It is a installable software which consist Java Runtime Environment (JRE), Java Virtual Machine (JVM), compiler (javac), interpreter (java), an archiver (.jar), document generator (Javadoc) and other tools needed for java application development.

JRE 
----
JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment.
JRE is a part of a JDK that provides very good environment to run java applications only.

JVM 
----
JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.
JVM is a part of a JRE which execute our program line by line procedure and it converts byte code to machine code.
