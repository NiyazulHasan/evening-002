Abstraction
===========
Hiding internal implementation and highlighting the set of services is called abstraction.

The best example of abstraction is GUI ATM machine where bank people will hide internal implementation and highlights the set of services like banking, withdrawl, mini statement and etc.

Using abstract classes and interfaces we can implements abstraction.

The main advantages of abstraction are 

1) It gives security because it hides internal implementation from outsiders.

2) Enhancement becomes more easy because without effecting end user they can perform 
   any changes in our internal system.

3) It provides flexibility to the enduser to use the system.

4) It improves maintainability of an application.




Encapsulation
==============
The process of encapsulating or wrapping variables and it's associate methods in a single entity is called encapsulation.

The best example of encapsulation is capsule.

Diagram: class28.1

Abstraction is used to hide the data and encapsulation is used to protect the data.

A class is said to be encapsulated class if it supports data hiding and abstraction.

In encapsulation for every variable we need to generate setter and getter methods.

The main advantages of encapsulation are 

1) It gives security .
2) Enhancement becomes more easy.
3) It provides flexibility to the enduser.
4) It improves maintainability of an application.

The main disadvantage of encapsulation is , it will increase the length of our code and slow down the execution process.

ex:
---
class Student
{
	//current class variables 
	private int studId;
	private String studName;
	private double studFee;
	
	//setter methods 
	public void setStudId(int studId)
	{
		this.studId=studId;
	}
	public void setStudName(String studName)
	{
		this.studName=studName;
	}
	public void setStudFee(double studFee)
	{
		this.studFee=studFee;
	}
	
	//getter methods 
	public int getStudId()
	{
		return studId;
	}
	public String getStudName()
	{
		return studName;
	}
	public double getStudFee()
	{
		return studFee;
	}
}
class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Student s = new Student();
		s.setStudId(101);
		s.setStudName("Alan");
		s.setStudFee(10000d);
		
		System.out.println("Student Id :"+s.getStudId());
		System.out.println("Student Name :"+s.getStudName());
		System.out.println("Student Fee : "+s.getStudFee());
	}
}


Is-A relationship 
================
Is-A relationship is also known as inheritance.

By using extends keyword we can implements Is-A relationship.

The main objective of Is-A relationship is to provide reusability.

ex:
---
class Parent 
{
	public void methodOne()
	{
		System.out.println("Parent-MethodOne");
	}
}
class Child extends Parent
{
	public void methodTwo()
	{
		System.out.println("Child-MethodTwo");
	}
}
class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Parent p = new Parent();
		p.methodOne(); // Parent-MethodOne
		
		Child c = new Child();
		c.methodOne(); // Parent-MethodOne
		c.methodTwo(); // Child-MethodTwo
		
		Parent p1 = new Child();
		p1.methodOne(); 
		
		 // Child c1 = new Parent();
	}
}

Inheritance 
===========
Inheritance is a mechanism in which a class inherits the properties of another class.

In inheritance we will derived a class in the presence of existing class.

The main objective of inheritance is to achieve reusability.

Using extends keyword we can achieve inheritance.

Diagram: class28.2

We have following list of inheritance.

1) Single Level Inheritance 

2) Multi Level Inheritance 

3) Multiple Inheritance 

4) Hierarchical Inheritance 

5) Hybrid Inheritance 


1) Single Level Inheritance 
----------------------------
If we derived a class in the presence of one base class is called single level inheritance.
ex:
	A (parent/super/base class)
	|
	|
	B (child/sub/derived class)

class A 
{
	public void m1()
	{
		System.out.println("M1-Method");
	}
}
class B extends A 
{
	public void m2()
	{
		System.out.println("M2-Method");
	}
}
class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		A a = new A();
		a.m1();
		
		B b = new B();
		b.m1();
		b.m2();
	}
}
