	37823


class Example8
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		int hours = 10;
		int minutes = 30;
		int seconds = 23;
		
		int totalSeconds = (hours*3600) + (minutes*60) + seconds;
		
		System.out.println(totalSeconds);
	}
}


Q) 

There is a running race between different participants. So in that race two partners need to finish the race. There is four rounds in that each lane length is 100m. So in that one participant will cover 30% of the lane length and another partner will cover remaining length of lane. So print each participant covers distance in that race.

ex:
---
class Example9
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		int lane = 100;
		int rounds = 4;
		int firstParticipantPercent = 30;
		
		int firstParticipant =  lane * rounds * firstParticipantPercent / 100;
		
		int secondParticipant = lane * rounds - firstParticipant;
		
		System.out.println("First Participant covered "+firstParticipant+" Distance");
		System.out.println("Second Participant covered "+secondParticipant+" Distance");
	}
}

Q)  Write a java program to accept one salary and find out 10% of TDS?

input:
	1000
output:
	100 

import java.util.Scanner;
class Example10
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter the salary :");
		int salary = sc.nextInt();
		
		int tds = salary*10/100;
		
		System.out.println(tds);
	}
}

TypeCasting 
============
The process of converting from one datatype to another datatype is called typecasting.

In java , typecasting can be done in two ways.

1) Implicit typecasting 

2) Explicit typecasting 

1) Implicit typecasting 
-----------------------
If want to store small value into a bigger variable then we need to use implicit typecasting.

A compiler is responsible to perform implicit typecasting.

There is no possibility to loss the information.

It is also known as widening or upcasting.

We can perform implicit typecasting as follow.

ex:
	byte 	-->	short
				-->
					int -->	long --> float --> double
				-->
			char 

ex:
---

class Test
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		byte b = 10;
		
		int i = b;
		
		System.out.println(i); 
	}
}

ex:

class Test
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		char ch = 'a';
		
		long l = ch;
		
		System.out.println(l); // 97 
	}
}

ex:
---

class Test
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		int i = 10;
		
		double d = i;
		
		System.out.println(d); // 10.0 
	}
}
