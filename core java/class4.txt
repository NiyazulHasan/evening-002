Comments in java
================
Comments are created for documentation purpose.

Comments are used to improve readability of our code.

It is highly recommended to use comments in regular programming.

Diagram: class4.1

Comments will not display in output because they won't compiled by the compiler.

We have two types of comments.

1) Single Line comment 
------------------
	It is used to comment a single line.
	ex:
		// comment here 

2) Multiple Line comment 
--------------------
	It is used to comment multiple lines.
	ex:	
		/*
			-
			- comment here 
			-
		*/

Program 
-------
//class declaration 
class  Test
{
	//main method 
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		//variable declaration 
		int x = 10;

		//output statement 
		System.out.println(x); 
	}
}
