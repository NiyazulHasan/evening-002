Q) Write a java program to copy the data from one file to another file?

input:
	source.txt 
	----------
	a
	ab
	abc
	abcd 

ex:
---
import java.io.*;
class Test  
{
	public static void main(String[] args)  
	{
		try(
				FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("source.txt");
				FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("destination.txt");
			)
		{
			int byteReads=0;
			while((byteReads = fis.read())!=-1)
			{
				fos.write(byteReads);
			}  
			System.out.println("Data Copied");
		}
		catch (IOException ioe)
		{
			ioe.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
}

Serialization 
=============
The process of storing object data into a file is called serialization.

Converting from object state to file state is called serialization.

To perform serialization we required ObjectOutputStream and FileOutputStream class.

We can perform serialization only for serialized object.

To create a serialized object our class must implement Serializable interface.

Serializable is a marker interface which does not have any methods or constants.

By using marker interface we will get some ability by JVM.

Diagram: class38.1


import java.io.*;
class Person implements Serializable 
{
	private int age;
	private String name;
	
	Person(int age,String name)
	{
		this.age = age;
		this.name = name;
	}
	public String toString()
	{
		return age+" "+name;
	}
}
class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Person p = new Person(29,"Alan");
		try(ObjectOutputStream outputStream = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("sreenivas.txt"));)
		{
			outputStream.writeObject(p);
			System.out.println("Data inserted");
		}
		catch (IOException ioe)
		{
			ioe.printStackTrace();
		}
		
	}
}

Deserialization 
================
The process of taking the data from file and representing an object is called deserialization.

Converting from file state to object state is called deserialization.

To perform deserialization we required ObjectInputStream and FileInputStream class.

We can perform deserialization only for serialized object.

To create serialized object our class must implements Serializable interface.

Serializable is a marker interface which does not have any methods or constants.

By using marker interface we will get some ability by JVM.

Diagram: class38.2


import java.io.*;
class Person implements Serializable 
{
	private int age;
	private String name;
	
	Person(int age,String name)
	{
		this.age = age;
		this.name = name;
	}
	public String toString()
	{
		return age+" "+name;
	}
}
class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		
		try(ObjectInputStream inputStream = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("sreenivas.txt"));)
		{
			Person p = (Person) inputStream.readObject();
			System.out.println(p);
		}
		catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e)
		{
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		
	}
}

Types of objects 
=================
We have two types of objects in java.

1) Immutable object 
--------------------
After object creation if we perform any changes then for every change a new object will be created such type of object is called immutable object.
ex:
	String and Wrapper classes 

2) Mutable object 
-----------------
After object creation if we perform any changes then all the required changes will be done in a same object such type of object is called mutable object.
ex:
	StringBuffer and StringBuilder 



java.util package
=================

Q) What is the difference between Arrays and Collections?

Arrays						Collections 
-------						-------------
It is a collection of homogeneous data 		It is a collection of homogeneous and 
elements.					hetrogeneous data elements.

It is fixed in size.				It is growable in nature.

Performance point of view arrays are 		Memory point of view Collections are 	
recommanded to use.				recommanded to use.

Arrays not implements based on data structure 	Collections are implemented based on 
concept so we can't expect any ready made 	data structure concept we can expect ready 
methods.					made methods.

It can hold primitive types and object types.	It can hold only object types.


Collection Framework 
====================
It defines several utility classes and interfaces to represent group of objects in a single entity.
ex:
	Java			C++
	-----			----
	Collection 		STL - Standard Template Library
	Collection Framework	Containers 

Collection 
===========
Collection is an interface which is present in java.util package.

It is a root interface for entire Collection Framework.

If we want to represent group of individual objects in a single entity then we need to use Collection.

Collection interface contains some command methods which are available for entire Collection objects.
ex:
	cmd> javap   java.util.Collection 	

List 
=====
It is a child interface of Collection interface.

If we want to represent group of individual objects in a single entity where duplicate objects are allowed and order is preserved then we need to use List interface.

Diagram: class38.3


Arraylist 
-----------
The underlying data structure is resizable array or growable array.

Duplicate objects are allowed.

Insertion order is preserved.

Hetrogeneous objects are allowed.

Null insertion is possible.

ex:
---
import java.util.*;
class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		ArrayList al = new ArrayList();
		al.add("one");
		al.add("two");
		al.add("three");
		System.out.println(al); //[one,two,three]
		
		al.add("one");
		System.out.println(al); // [one,two,three,one]
		
		al.add(10);
		System.out.println(al); //[one,two,three,one,10]
		
		al.add(null);
		System.out.println(al); //[one,two,three,one,10,null]
	}
}

ex:
---
import java.util.*;
class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		ArrayList<String> al = new ArrayList<String>();
		al.add("one");
		al.add("two");
		al.add("three");
		System.out.println(al); //[one,two,three]
		
		al.add("one");
		System.out.println(al); // [one,two,three,one]
		
		al.add(null);
		System.out.println(al); //[one,two,three,one,null]
	}
}

ex:
---
import java.util.*;
class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		ArrayList<String> al = new ArrayList<String>();
		al.add("one");
		al.add("two");
		al.add("three");
		
		for(int i=0;i<al.size();i++)
		{
			System.out.println(al.get(i));
		}
	}
}

ex:
---
import java.util.*;
class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
		list.add(10);
		list.add(20);
		list.add(30);
		
		for(int i : list)
		{
			System.out.print(i+" ");
		}
	}
}

ex:
---
import java.util.*;
class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		List<Integer> list = List.of(6,2,9,1,4,5);
	
		for(int i : list)
		{
			System.out.print(i+" ");
		}
	}
}
