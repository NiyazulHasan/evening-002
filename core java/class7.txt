Internal Architecture of JVM 
============================
Diagram : class7.1

Java program contains java code instructions. Once if we compiled java code instructions convert to byte code instructions in .class file.

JVM will invoke one module called classloader or subsystem to load all the byte code instructions from .class file. The work of classloader is to check these byte code instructions are proper or not. If they are not proper then it will refuse the execution. If they are proper then it will allocates memory. 

We have five memories in java.

1) Method Area 
--------------
Method area contains code of a class, code of a variable and code of a method.

2) Heap
------
Our object creations will store in heap area.

3) Java Stack 
-------------
Java methods store in method area but to execute those methods we required some memory and that memory will be allocated in java stack.

4) PC register 
---------------
It is a program counter register which is used to track the address of an instructions.

5) Native Method Stack 
-----------------------
Java methods execute in method area.
Similarly native methods execute in native method stack.
But to execute native methods we required a program called Native method interface.

Execution Engine 
-----------------
Execution engine contains interpreter and JIT compiler.

Whenever JVM loads byte code instructions from .class file. It simultaneously uses interpreter and JIT compiler.

Interpreter is execute our program line by line procedure.

JIT compiler is used to increase the execution speed of our program.

Finally JVM converts byte code to machine code.


Interview Questions 
===================

Q) How many memories are there in java?

We have five memories in java.

1) Method Area 
2) Heap 
3) Java Stack 
4) PC Register 
5) Native Method Stack 



Q) What is JIT compiler?

JIT stands for Just In Time.
It is a part of a JVM which is used to increase the execution speed of our program.



Q) What is Native Method in Java?

A method which is developed by using some other language is called Native method.


Q) A .class file contains what code?

	byte code 


Q) How many classloaders are there in java?

We have three predefined classloaders in java.
1) Bootstrap classloader 
2) Extension classloader
3) Application/System classloader 


Identifiers
===========
A name which is given to program elements like classes, variables, methods, interfaces , packages and etc.

A name in java is called identifier. It can be variable name, method name, class name or label name.

ex:
	class Test
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{	
			int x = 10;
	
			System.out.println(x); 
		}
	}
	Here Test, main, args and x are identifiers.

Rules to declare an identifiers
--------------------------------

Rule1:
------
	Identifier will accept following characters.
	ex:
		A-Z
		a-z
		0-9
		_
		$

Rule2:
------
	If we take other characters then we will get compile time error.
	ex:
		int  emp_id; 	
		int  emp$alary;
		int  emp#id; //invalid 

Rule3:
-----
	Every identifier is a case sensitive.
	ex:
		int a=10;
		int A=10;

Rule4:
-----
	Every identifer must starts with alphabet, underscore or dollar symbol 
	but not with digits.
	ex:
		int  _abcd; 
		int  $;
		int  a1234;
		int  1abcd; //invalid 

Rule5:
-----
	We can't take reserved words as an identifiers.
	ex:
		int if; //invalid 
		int else; //invalid 
		int  for; /invalid 

Rule6:
------
	There is no length limit for an identifier but it is not recommanded to take 
	more then 15 characters.
