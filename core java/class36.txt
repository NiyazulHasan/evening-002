Exception Handling 
==================

Q) What is the difference between Exception and Error?

Exception 
---------
	Exception is a problem for which we can provide solution programmatically.
	Exception will occur due to syntax errors.
	ex:
		ArithmeticException 
		FileNotFoundException 
		IllegalArgumentException 

Error 
-----
	Error is a problem for which we can't provide solution programmatically.
	Error will occur due to lack of system resources.
	ex:
		OutOfMemoryError 
		StackOverFlowError 
		LinkageError 

As a part of java application development it is a responsibility of a programmer to provide smooth termination for every java program.

We have two types of terminations.

1) Smooth termination 
--------------------
During the program execution suppose if we are not getting any interruption in the middle of the program such type of termination is called smooth termination.

ex:
---
class Test  
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		System.out.println("Hello World!");
	}
}

2) Abnormal termination 
------------------------
During the program execution suppose if we are getting any interruption in the middle of the program such type of termination is called abnormal termination.

ex:
---
class Test  
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		System.out.println(10/0);
	}
}

If any exception raised in our program we must and should handle that exception otherwise our program will terminates abnormally.

Here exception will display name of the exception, description of the exception and line number of the exception.

Exception 
=========
It is a unwanted , unexpected event which disturbs normal flow of a program.

Exceptions always raise at runtime so they are also known as runtime events. 

The main objective of exception handling is to provide graceful termination.

In java, exception are divided into two types.

1) Predefined exceptions 

2) Userdefined exceptions 

1) Predefined exceptions 
--------------------------
Built-In exceptions are called predefined exceptions.

It is classified into two types.

Diagram: class36.1

i) Checked exceptions 
-------------------
Exceptions which are checked by the compiler at the time of compilation are called checked exceptions.
ex:
	IOException 
	InterruptedException 
	EOFException 
	and etc.	

ii) Unchecked exceptions 
------------------------
Exceptions which are checked by the JVM at the time of runtime are called unchecked exceptions.
ex:
	ArithmeticException 
	ClassCastException 
	IllegalArgumentException 
	and etc.

If any checked exception raised in our program we must and should handle that exception by using try and catch block.

try block 
----------
It is a block which contains risky code.

It associate with catch block and finally block.

If any exception raised in try block then it won't be executed.

It is used to throw the exception to catch block.


catch block 
-----------
It is a block which contains error handling code.

It always associate with try block.

It is used to catch exception which is thrown by try block.

A catch block will take exception name as a parameter and that name must match with exception class name.

If there is no exception in try block then catch block won't be executed.

syntax:
------
	try 
	{
		- // Risky Code 
	}
	catch(ArithmeticException ae)
	{
		- // Error Handling Code 
	}

ex:1
---
class Test  
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		try
		{
			System.out.println("try-block");	
		}
		catch (Exception e)
		{
			System.out.println("catch-block");
		}
	}
}
o/p:
	try-block 

ex:2
----
class Test  
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		try
		{
			System.out.println(10/0);	
		}
		catch (ArithmeticException ae)
		{
			System.out.println("catch-block");
		}
	}
}
o/p:
	catch-block 

ex:3
----
class Test  
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		try
		{
			System.out.println("stmt1");
			System.out.println(10/0);
			System.out.println("stmt2");
		}
		catch (ArithmeticException ae)
		{
			System.out.println("catch-block");
		}
	}
}


Q) Write a java program to display Hello World , without using println() ?

import java.io.*;
class Test  
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		try
		{
			String str = "Hello World";
			System.out.write(str.getBytes());
		}
		catch (IOException ioe)
		{
			System.out.println(ioe.toString());
		}
	}
}

A try block can have multiple catch blocks. 

ex:
---
class Test  
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		try
		{
			System.out.println(10/0);
		}
		catch (ArithmeticException ae)
		{
			System.out.println("From AE");
		}
		catch (RuntimeException re)
		{
			System.out.println("From RE");
		}
	}
}

Various ways to display the exceptions details
==============================================
Throwable class defines following three methods to display exception details.

1) printStackTrace() 
--------------------
It is used to display name of the exception, description of the exception and line number of the exception.

2) toString() 
------------
It is used to display name of the exception and description of the exception.

3) getMessage
------------
It is used to display description of the exception.

ex:

class Test  
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		try
		{
			System.out.println(10/0);
		}
		catch (ArithmeticException ae)
		{
			ae.printStackTrace();
			
			System.out.println("=================");
			
			System.out.println(ae.toString());
			
			System.out.println("=================");
			
			System.out.println(ae.getMessage());
		}
		
	}
}

We can handle multiple exceptions using single catch block.

ex:
---
class Test  
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		try
		{
			//System.out.println(10/0);
			
			/*
			int[] arr=null;
			System.out.println(arr[0]);
			*/
			
			Thread.currentThread().setPriority(11);
		}
		catch (ArithmeticException | NullPointerException | IllegalArgumentException e)
		{
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
}

Try-with-resources 
==================
A try-with-resources introduced in Java 7.

A try-with-resource is a try block which contains one or more resources.

A try-with-resources ensures that each resources must be closed at the end of the statement.

ex:
---
import java.util.Scanner;
class Test  
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		try(Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);)
		{
			System.out.println("Enter the name :");
			String name = sc.nextLine();
		
			System.out.println("Welcome :"+name);
		}
		catch (Exception e )
		{
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
